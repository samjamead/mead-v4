There was once a man who became unstuck in the world. He realised that he was not his car, he realised that he was not his job, he was not his phone, his desk or his shoes. Like a boat cut from its anchor, he began to drift.

He took the wind for a map, he took the sky for a clock, and he set off with no destination. He was never lost.

Instead of hooks or a net, he threw himself into the sea. He was never thirsty.

With a Polaroid camera he made pictures of all the people he met, and then he gave all the pictures away. He would never forget their faces.

Each person he met became a little less stuck themselves. He traveled only with himself and he was never alone.

He traveled around like a leaf in the wind until he reached the place where he started out. His car, his job, his phone, his shoes – everything was right where he’d left it. Nothing had changed, and yet he felt excited to have arrived here - as if this were the place he’d been going all along.

_This is a poem from the film_ [Castles In The Sky](https://vimeo.com/ondemand/castlesinthesky) _by Taylor Steele. I can't find any other reference to it so it's possible that Taylor wrote it himself..._
