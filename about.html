  <p>In my last year of university I cofounded a company with some friends. It didn’t go very well, we learnt a lot, and my second attempt has done much better. I came to WA as a love tourist in March 2013, and for the first year or so I flew back and forth to London to keep building Saberr. Since January 2015 I’ve been helping other startups, entrepreneurs and small businesses avoid some of the mistakes that I’ve made along the way. Call it freelancing, mentorship, advice, coaching or whatever — I love collaborating with everyone here in the Perth startup scene.</p>

    Then came the night of the first falling star. The spectacle before us was indeed sublime.

  <p>Recently I’ve been part of a few really exciting projects — Uproute, a company helping travellers plan perfect itineraries; Snaptrash, the continuation of an environmental project that came second at the seventh Startup Weekend Perth; and as a mentor for Vocus Upstart, a tech accelerator here in the city.</p>

  <p>If you’re interested in having a chat, I’d love to hear from you, so come along to Morning Startup or shoot me a Tweet and let’s start the conversation!</p>

  <p>Outside of tech startups, I’m passionate about making the world a little bit more environmentally conscious, as well as surfing, skiing, and camping. And Oxford commas, golf, and woodwork. And languages. I have too many hobbies.</p>
